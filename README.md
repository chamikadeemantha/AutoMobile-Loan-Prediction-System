An intelligent software solution to predict automobile loan defaulting.

This project was developed as part of the 3rd Year 1st semester project for the Fundamentals of Data Mining module in the BSc.(Hons) Information Technology Specializing in Data Science.

Introduction


In todayâ€™s context, the ongoing financial crisis, coupled with rising inflation and interest rates, has stretched consumers' financial strength. This has resulted in significant issues within the financial system. Given the inadequacy of public transport and the need for private vehicles in every household, a substantial proportion of loans fall within the automobile/auto loan category. These loans are especially vulnerable to customer default, as they often do not provide any financial return.

Recently, defaults on automobile loans have surged, severely impacting the profit margins of non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs), which are major auto loan lenders. To address this, Group Mining Marsters identified a market opportunity to support NBFIs by developing an intelligent software solution capable of predicting loan default probabilities. This system allows NBFIs to approve or reject loan requests with high accuracy, potentially reducing the financial losses associated with loan defaults. By estimating a client's ability to repay the loan within the specified time, the system can also suggest loan extensions when necessary.

LoanDrive was developed to meet these needs. LoanDrive is an intelligent software solution that addresses this business requirement by assisting NBFIs in making informed decisions. LoanDrive uses a custom-built predictive model trained on a live dataset tailored to the specific business requirements.
