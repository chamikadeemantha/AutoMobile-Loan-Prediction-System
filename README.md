An intelligent software solution to predict automobile loan defaulting.
This was done as a part of the 3rd Year 2nd semester project of the Fundamentals of Data Mining module of BSc.(Hons) Information Technology Specializing Data Science.

Introduction
In todayâ€™s context due to the current financial crisis and with the increased inflation rate and the increase in the interest rates, consumers have been stretched thin with regard to financial strength. This has created issues within the financial system. With the problems and inadequacy in public transport and every household needing a private vehicle, out of the overall loans, a high volume of loans belongs to the Automobile / Auto loan category, and they are the most vulnerable for customers defaulting, as the majority do not provide any financial return. Thus, defaulting on automobile loans has increased significantly in recent times and NBFI profit margins have been hit largely due to this as they are the prominent lenders of auto loans. We at group CYWAA identified a market opportunity to help NBFIs by developing an intelligent software intelligence solution that can predict the customer loan defaulting possibility and provide a system for the NBFIs to approve or reject customer loan requests with high accuracy. This might lessen the financial loss that could result from a client's payment default by enabling the business to estimate whether the client can afford the amount in the allotted time and extend the loan. Thus, Mobiloan was produced, Mobiloan is an intelligent software solution that addresses the aforementioned business requirement and assists NBFIs in decision-making. Mobiloan utilizes a predictive model which was custom-built and tuned for the specific task and trained with a live dataset that mimics the business requirements
